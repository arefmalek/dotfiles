# Dotfiles

I just keep track of stuff I need for my dev workflow, here's what I use:
- install zsh
- Change shell to zsh
- install ![ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
- install ![vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation)
    * setup ![coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
